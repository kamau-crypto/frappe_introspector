# The main entry point for my flask app is the app.py file.
flask --app app run --FLASK_DEBUG=1

## Working with Markdown Files

### 1. Working with Flask Markdown  with Pygments

- Flask-Markdown is a Flask extension that integrates Markdown rendering into your Flask applications, allowing you to easily display content written in Markdown format. When combined with Pygments, it provides syntax highlighting for code blocks within your Markdown text, enhancing readability and presentation

- Installation: You would install both Flask-Markdown and Pygments using pip3:

```bash
    pip3 install Flask-Markdown Pygments
```

- You will need to include a CSS stylesheet generated by Pygments to apply the highlighting styles. Pygments can generate various styles, and you can choose one that suits your design.
Pygments CSS:

- To get the syntax highlighting to visually appear, you need to include a Pygments-generated CSS file in your HTML. You can generate this using the pygmentize command-line tool.

```bash
    pygmentize -S default -f html > static/css/pygments.css
```
(Replace default with your preferred style and static/css/pygments.css with your desired output path.)
